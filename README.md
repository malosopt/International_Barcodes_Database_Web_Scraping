International Barcodes Database
The International Barcodes Database is a GTIN (barcode number) and product database designed to provide product information based on barcode numbers (UPC or EAN formats). You can search this barcode database by barcode number, to find out product information based on that barcode number, and where the product is available.

This database contains GTINs (barcode numbers) issued by the International Barcodes Network plus some other verified GTINs.
